        "about": "👋 Hi, I’m Soren! I’m a graduate student in Natural Language Processing at UC Santa Cruz, where I also serve as a Teaching Assistant for courses like Business Information Systems and Systems Analysis and Design. I help students master databases, agile methods, UML modeling, and team collaboration.\n\n🏄‍♂️ I’m consulting with Onda Sports, where we’re building intelligent tools to help surfers better understand conditions and discover where to paddle out next. I’ve been prototyping LLM-powered features, refining system architecture, and advising early marketing strategy.\n\n🐋 I'm also working with Gray Whale, contributing across backend systems, automation tools, and product infrastructure — supporting their mission to make AI-powered workflows smoother and more scalable.\n\n🌊 I previously worked at Boardal, a surf gear marketplace, where I integrated various features, including a custom surfboard notification system.\n\n🌐 I’m passionate about building practical, agent-based AI tools — systems that are useful, grounded, and a joy to use. My current focus is on orchestrating multi-agent systems, reducing hallucinations in LLMs, and aligning models with real-world user needs.\n\n🎉 I stay active in the local tech scene by participating in Santa Cruz Works events and enjoy connecting with others at the intersection of AI, education, and surf culture.\n\n🤝 Excited to chat about NLP, ML, and AI — and always happy to pay it forward. If you’re a student in CS or a related field, curious about these topics, or want to hear about my experiences and perspectives, feel free to reach out. And if you’re up for surfing around Santa Cruz or NorCal, even better — let’s set up a 1:1!"
