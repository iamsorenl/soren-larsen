    "about": "Hi, I'm Soren! I'm a recent graduate of the Master's program in Natural Language Processing at UC Santa Cruz.\n\nDuring my time there, I TA'd several courses in AI and Information Systems. I've also spent a lot of time in people-facing roles, which shaped how I communicate, teach, and collaborate, whether that's working with students or coaching in board sports.\n\nLately, I've focused on building agent-based AI systems, especially tools that align language models with real-world needs. I've worked across backend infrastructure, product design, and LLM prototyping at startups like Gray Whale, and I formerly worked at Onda Sports. I also previously developed features for the surf marketplace app Boardal.\n\nI love collaborating on projects that mix practicality with innovation, especially in NLP and AI. Always happy to connect about anything from multi-agent orchestration to surfing!"
