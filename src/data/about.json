    "about": "👋 Hi, I’m Soren! I’m a graduate student in Natural Language Processing at UC Santa Cruz, where I also serve as a Teaching Assistant for multiple courses in Baskin Engineering — including CSE 140: Artificial Intelligence (supporting student learning in search, game playing, machine learning, and symbolic/neural approaches) as well as TIM 50: Business Information Systems and TIM 58: Systems Analysis and Design (helping students master databases, agile methods, UML modeling, and team collaboration).\n\n🐋 I’m working with Gray Whale, contributing across backend systems, automation tools, and product infrastructure — supporting their mission to make AI-powered workflows smoother and more scalable.\n\n🏄‍♂️ I also work with Onda Sports, where we’re building intelligent tools to help surfers better understand conditions and discover where to paddle out next. I’ve been prototyping LLM-powered features, refining system architecture, and advising early marketing strategy.\n\n🌊 I previously worked at Boardal, a mobile surf gear marketplace application, where I integrated various features, including a custom surfboard notification system.\n\n🌐 I’m passionate about building practical, agent-based AI tools — systems that are useful, grounded, and a joy to use. My current focus is on orchestrating multi-agent systems, reducing hallucinations in LLMs, and aligning models with real-world user needs.\n\n🎉 I actively follow the local tech scene in Santa Cruz and around the Bay Area. Some of my favorite events have been sponsored by Santa Cruz Works!\n\n🤝 Excited to chat about NLP, ML, and AI — and always happy to pay it forward. If you’re a student in CS or a related field, curious about these topics, or want to hear about my experiences and perspectives, feel free to reach out. And if you’re up for surfing around Santa Cruz or NorCal, even better — let’s set up a 1:1!"
